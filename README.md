# Data Mining Project: Bees Flight Behavior
## Description
The aim of this project was to make predictions about bee behavior by analyzing weather and bee flight data. The final report contains information on data preprocessing, analysis and regression of temperature data, and classification of flight behavior. 

## Methods Used
Various methods were used to analyze and process the data as part of the project, including:
- Data preprocessing
- Regression of temperature data
- Classification of flight behavior
- Analysis of correlations between attributes

## Sources
During the project, various sources were used to deepen the understanding of data mining methods and techniques. Some of the sources used were:
- The documentation of scikit-learn
- Textbooks on the subject of data mining
- Lecture materials from the course

## Results
The results of the project showed that it is possible to make predictions about bee behavior by analyzing weather and bee flight data. In particular, certain attributes were identified that have a strong influence on bee flight behavior.

## Authors and acknowledgment
